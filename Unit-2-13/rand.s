/* -- rand.s
rand.s gives us an array of 100 pseudo-random numbers
in the range 0 <= n < 100 based on Knuthâ€™s advice.
X[n+1] <- (aX[n] + c) mod m
using m = 2^16 = 65536 which works on a 16-bit machine well
using a = 32445 so that a mod 8 = 5 and 99m/100 > a > m/100
using c = 1
using X0 = 31416 in r0 as seed (could be input)
